In this page, you can read about ruralline's own Lore, This lore details more the line owns history while the Global-lore tells more about the whole Universe.
This lore only tells about the LVP-side history due line was extended to rockport in 1996 so there is no reason to write detailed history of that stub.

## 1900 - 1935 :
First plans of a T23 tram line was planned to come from Lakeview central station all the way to the Today's Market Street station.<br>
The whole 1900 - 1935 years were huge battle with landowners, This came to end in 1935 due shifting politics in the country. 

## 1935 - 1950 :
Due war damages, shifting political parties, Region becoming Sovereign country.<br>
Not lot of planning was made and most of lines were closed. 

## 1950 - 1960 :
After country becoming sovereign, Lakeview metropolitan was closed by the city and new company Lakeview transport (LVP) was created.<br>
**1955** saw LVP starting to revive old tram lines and converting some of the lines to Subway test lines, This saw plan of TR23 getting replanned and becoming M52.<br>
Construction was meant to start in 1956 but political shitstorm was so huge that planning of the subway network was slow.<br>
in 1958 subway stock deal with American's fell thru due gauge and power network issues.
1960 saw LVP ordering subway stock from Russia due their compatibility with the subway Infrastructure from RPM. 

## 1960 - 1970 :
1961 building on M52 started, alr in 1962 first section between Lakeview City Hall - Urban Park was open and in service, Tunnel section to Ravenholm & rocklake was finished in 1964, Tunnelling works were easy due soft rockbed of the region. <br>
Line was opened to the service in 1965 with 8 three wagon sets of 81-702's.Due landowner issues Line did not open with depot. Tunnel tracks for future Rocklake depot were build.<br>
For years LVP had to do stock maintenance at temp depot where stock needed to be lifted out of tunnel via Ravenholm Train lift. 

## 1970 - 1980 :
In 1973 LVP finally bought land to build the Rocklake depot, but due land was small, they could built 6 track depot with no wash hall's.<br>
Last train to visit the temp depot at Ravenholm & use the train lift was new 81-703 E type what was ordered to replace burned D type.<br>
In summer of 1973 Temp depot and train lift was decommissioned, The same train Lift is still in place after / before ravenholm station but not in use anymore.  Same summer LVP order more E types to replace D types on the M50, M51, M52 lines.
In 1975 LVP started planning of the Ravenholm - Market Street Extension for M52 line, Extension was needed due Ravenholm station usage was small due it's close distance to the Aviation university Station.  Same year 40% of the Subway test lines were closed due them not making ends-meet.

Between 1960 to 1975 LVP had total of 12 Subway test lines. after 1975 only 6 was left.
Tram & bus lines in the city centre were making profit while most of the Subway lines were outskirts of the central.

1975 to 1980 LVP started to order used subway stock from Russia to fill the gaps in extra stock + extend wagon numbers from 3 to 4. 

## 1980 - 1997:
In 1980 LVP started to hit hardships. But this did not LPV from starting two new projects for M52, M52 was ideal line to be extended under the Rockriver to Rockport region and connect with RPM network.<br>
In 1981 LVP & RPM started to talk about connection between these two regions, RPM was just worried due Rocklake station was not facing to the river's way but to the Lakeview central.<br>
This direction was decided to in future LVP could extend the line to the central, but that never happened.<br>

LVP came with idea: LVP pays 80% of the new alignment from Urban Park to the new Rocklake station while RPM only provides 20% of the cost for it.
Meanwhile the underwater crossing would be paid 70% LVP & 40% RPM.
Sametime all stations on M52 would need to be extended from 4 to 5 wagons and would require a new depot as the old one would be left on retiring alignment.

1982 constructions were started on new alignment & depot, Underwater tunnels would take few years more due shipping lane on the river.
1985 LVP started to cut down on expenses as the project what LVP started was too huge for alr failing economy of the company,
M52 became last line in 1986 as LVP closed all other lines and sold most of the stock from closed subway lines to RPM.

1990 Saw opening of the New alignment and depot, Meanwhile underwater tunnels slowed down due bedrock begin more soft than expected so that delayed project.

1993 Lakeview transport was announced bankrupted and all services of the LVP were overtaken by the city, City ran LVP's subway to 1997 when Underwater tunnels were done, As in 1997 RPM came and bought whole M52 line from City so lakeview city could finally kill the LVP, City had alr in 1995 ended all LVP's trams & bus services and started city owned company, Subway was something none wanted to buy due it's small size and lack of maintenance of the infrastructure and stock.

## 1997 - 2005 : 
When RPM bought ruralline, in 1998 they started many year rehabilitation & rebuilt project due how infrastructure  was build,
And due lack of maintenance, the tracks between Urban Park - Market street had lot of slow orders and even few substations needed to be rebuilt.

2005: whole project was done and line under RPM colours.
