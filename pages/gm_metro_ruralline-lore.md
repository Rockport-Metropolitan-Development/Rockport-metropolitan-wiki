In this page, you can read about ruralline's own lore. This lore details more about the line's own history, while the global lore tells more about the whole universe.
This lore only tells about the LVP-side history due line was extended to Rockport in 1996, so there is no reason to write a detailed history of that stub.

## 1900 - 1935  :
Market Street Line's (or Ruralline) history starts in the summer of 1900 with Lakeview town planning a tram network to better connect the small towns on the outskirts of the town.

But in many small towns, citizens did not want a cityfolk coming to their towns and scarning the horses with sielent-moving metal boxes. Lakeview officials were in huge battles with landowners and town leaders about plans. This lasted until 1935, when the politics of the region had changed quickly.

## 1935 - 1950 (WW2) :
The years from 1935 to 1950 were hard for the region due to changes in politics, war damage, and other shitstorms.

During the last months of the war, the region became sovereign country called Kramasko and ever since has been a Western coutry middle of Soviet ocean. (read more about coutnry history in the Global-Lore)

During the wartime most of Lakeview was bombed with Rockport over the river. Planning of tram network did go on but slowly.

## 1950 - 1960 :
In the summer of 1952, Lakeview revisted the tram plan and decided to build a subway. This became much easier due to almost the whole downtown being bombed during the war. In January of 1953, City released its subway plan, with a lot of joy from citizens. The same time project did draw some doubts from Rockport, as Lakeview was a small city with a very small downtown. Rockport estimated that the whole 12-line plan would not span out.

The city did show plans for new tram and bus networks at the same time. The whole subway network was planned as a semi-overground and was more of a testing network, as city officials did not have good ideas on the lineheading and style. Due to the Cold War in the summer, LVP had to abort the order of USA-made subway trains due to USSR blocking and forcing Kramasko to use mostly Eastern-block goods to stay sovereign. LVP placed an order for 24-waggons of D-type for Ruralline. Subway design was taken from RPM, as RPM was already building subways in USSR and its own mix style.

In 1954, the final routing of the lines and station locations was decided. In January of 1995, building works for all 12 subway lines started, and at the same time, the tram and bus networks started to operate. Between 1955 and 1960, the easiest lines were first built, and Ruralline was left in the last category with 3 other lines.

## 1960 - 1970 :
1961 building on M52 started, alr in 1962 first section between Lakeview City Hall - Urban Park was open and in service, Tunnel section to Ravenholm & rocklake was finished in 1964, Tunnelling works were easy due soft rockbed of the region. <br>
Line was opened to the service in 1965 with 8 three wagon sets of 81-702's.Due landowner issues Line did not open with depot. Tunnel tracks for future Rocklake depot were build.<br>
For years LVP had to do stock maintenance at temp depot where stock needed to be lifted out of tunnel via Ravenholm Train lift. 

## 1970 - 1980 :
In 1973 LVP finally bought land to build the Rocklake depot, but due land was small, they could built 6 track depot with no wash hall's.<br>
Last train to visit the temp depot at Ravenholm & use the train lift was new 81-703 E type what was ordered to replace burned D type.<br>
In summer of 1973 Temp depot and train lift was decommissioned, The same train Lift is still in place after / before ravenholm station but not in use anymore.  Same summer LVP order more E types to replace D types on the M50, M51, M52 lines.
In 1975 LVP started planning of the Ravenholm - Market Street Extension for M52 line, Extension was needed due Ravenholm station usage was small due it's close distance to the Aviation university Station.  Same year 40% of the Subway test lines were closed due them not making ends-meet.

Between 1960 to 1975 LVP had total of 12 Subway test lines. after 1975 only 6 was left.
Tram & bus lines in the city centre were making profit while most of the Subway lines were outskirts of the central.

1975 to 1980 LVP started to order used subway stock from Russia to fill the gaps in extra stock + extend wagon numbers from 3 to 4. 

## 1980 - 1997:
In 1980 LVP started to hit hardships. But this did not LPV from starting two new projects for M52, M52 was ideal line to be extended under the Rockriver to Rockport region and connect with RPM network.<br>
In 1981 LVP & RPM started to talk about connection between these two regions, RPM was just worried due Rocklake station was not facing to the river's way but to the Lakeview central.<br>
This direction was decided to in future LVP could extend the line to the central, but that never happened.<br>

LVP came with idea: LVP pays 80% of the new alignment from Urban Park to the new Rocklake station while RPM only provides 20% of the cost for it.
Meanwhile the underwater crossing would be paid 70% LVP & 40% RPM.
Sametime all stations on M52 would need to be extended from 4 to 5 wagons and would require a new depot as the old one would be left on retiring alignment.

1982 constructions were started on new alignment & depot, Underwater tunnels would take few years more due shipping lane on the river.
1985 LVP started to cut down on expenses as the project what LVP started was too huge for alr failing economy of the company,
M52 became last line in 1986 as LVP closed all other lines and sold most of the stock from closed subway lines to RPM.

1990 Saw opening of the New alignment and depot, Meanwhile underwater tunnels slowed down due bedrock begin more soft than expected so that delayed project.

1993 Lakeview transport was announced bankrupted and all services of the LVP were overtaken by the city, City ran LVP's subway to 1997 when Underwater tunnels were done, As in 1997 RPM came and bought whole M52 line from City so lakeview city could finally kill the LVP, City had alr in 1995 ended all LVP's trams & bus services and started city owned company, Subway was something none wanted to buy due it's small size and lack of maintenance of the infrastructure and stock.

## 1997 - 2005 : 
When RPM bought ruralline in 1998, they started many-year rehabilitation and rebuilding projects due to how infrastructure was built in the early years. Because of a lack of maintenance, the tracks between Urban Park and Market Street had a lot of slow orders, and even a few substations needed to be rebuilt due to their age and lack of spare parts.

In 2005, all rehabilitation and rebuilding projects were done, and Line was fully moved under RPM company colours and dispatching system.
